  <p> Hi aneeqah. I just wanted to tell you that i love you. Your happiness means the absolute world to me and when you smile i feel content with everyhting. In the abscence of the sun, you alone could give me enough warmth to survive within the cold harsh space. You are like a star in the night sky, you shine so bright, and your warmth is felt when i am close to you. You are the most beautiful, kind, sweet, amazing, and caring girl ever. You're my pari<3 i'm sorry i'm such a b word all the time, the truth is that i really seriously love you and i want to show you that i do. Without you i don't want to live, and i know all you want is my love, so i will give it to you in it's purest form meri jaan. I love you so much. I hope you keep smiling always my neeqah jaan, your shohar qasim loves you lots. <3.  </p>
